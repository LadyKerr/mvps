# Spotify MVP Project Instructions

This is a Spotify MVP built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The project focuses on core music streaming features without authentication:

## Core Features
- Music Library browsing and search
- Music Player with basic controls (play/pause, skip, volume, seek)
- Playlist management (create, add/remove songs)
- Queue management
- Search and discovery

## Technical Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- CSS modules or inline styles for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- HTML5 Audio API for music playback

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper TypeScript typing
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility
- Implement responsive design principles

## Project Structure
- `/src/components` - Reusable UI components
- `/src/pages` - Main app pages/views
- `/src/hooks` - Custom React hooks
- `/src/types` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/src/data` - Sample music data and mock APIs
- `/src/utils` - Utility functions

## Sample Data
Use mock music data with proper metadata including:
- Song title, artist, album, duration
- Album artwork URLs (placeholder images)
- Audio file URLs (use sample/demo audio files)
